# PDF1.6-Password-Encryptor

This project is using python and developed as a learning tool with an objective of imitating the encryption algorithms used in pdf file 1.6 to recover the utilized password. There are many programs designed to demonstrate different abilities. All programs are built for convenience of resuming back the previous work by saving the essential data in a text file at the instance of termination (you must press ctrl or cmd âŒ˜ + c) and consuming the stored data in the beginning. However, `test2pandas.py` employs pandas library to output the data at the end of the program to a csv file `(test.csv)`.
Each program iterates through different parts of ASCII characters.
